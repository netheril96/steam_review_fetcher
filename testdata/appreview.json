Disgraceful, it feels like chess, who thought this was a good idea? and the BALLS of the development team to stick to this losing system out of stubbornness despite the majority of us giving negative feedback on the combat system, heed a little advice and give the players what they want, I'm not sure if you are aware of it but a happy player base means more profits in the long run, unless of course this game is just a cash grab leeching off the success of its predecessor - a definite far cry from the original GreedFall masterpiece. You took a club and bludgeoned the seal pup that is this franchise to death.  D-I-S-A-P-P-O-I-N-T-M-E-N-T-!",
